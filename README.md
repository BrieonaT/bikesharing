# Summary
The results can be summed up in the following points. One is that it seems to be a thriving business in New York City, and tends to attract more subscribing customers than one-off customers, thus having a steady income stream. Also, a large percentage of the customers tend to be men. In addition, customers often use the service for around 5 minutes, and a large sum of customers use it on Thursdays at around 5pm to 6pm. However, you can still analyze this data further. One way to further analyze the data would be to find out the percentages of customer age ranges. In addition, you could also look into which times and weekdays certain customer age ranges tend to use the service.
